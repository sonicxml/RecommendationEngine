{"name":"RecommendationEngine","tagline":"Graph Toolkit and Recommendation Engine","body":"# Recommendation Engine\r\nGraph Toolkit and Recommendation Engine for a NETS 150 homework assignment.\r\n\r\nBuilt in the spring of Freshman Year (Spring '15) by UPenn students Trevin Gandhi, Seth Bartynski, and Deepan Saravanan. \r\n\r\nThis project contains 3 major parts:\r\n\r\n1. A Graph representation. This stores optionally weighted directed graphs. \r\n2. A Graph Toolkit. This provides basic (and more advanced) graph algorithms, such as BFS, DFS, Topological Sort, Kosaraju's, and Edmonds-Karp.\r\n3. A Recommendation Engine. This uses the Graph representation to provide recommendations to users of services. \r\n\r\nThus, our project meets the following guidelines:\r\n\r\n-  It fits mostly into the \"Implementation\" category, and can also reach into the \"Empirical Analysis\" category if we get enough time to run our recommendation engine on real data. \r\n-  It contains both graph algorithms and recommendations. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
