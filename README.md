# Recommendation Engine
Graph Toolkit and Recommendation Engine for a NETS 150 homework assignment.

Built in the spring of Freshman Year (Spring '15) by UPenn students Trevin Gandhi, Seth Bartynski, and Deepan Saravanan. 

This project contains 3 major parts:

1. A Graph representation. This stores optionally weighted directed graphs. 
2. A Graph Toolkit. This provides basic (and more advanced) graph algorithms, such as BFS, DFS, Topological Sort, Kosaraju's, and Edmonds-Karp.
3. A Recommendation Engine. This uses the Graph representation to provide recommendations to users of services. 

Thus, our project meets the following guidelines:

-  It fits mostly into the "Implementation" category, and can also reach into the "Empirical Analysis" category if we get enough time to run our recommendation engine on real data. 
-  It contains both graph algorithms and recommendations.
