# Recommendation Engine
Graph Toolkit and Recommendation Engine for a NETS 150 project.

Built in the spring of Freshman Year (Spring '15). 

This project contains 3 major parts:

1. A Graph representation. This stores optionally weighted directed graphs. 
2. A Graph Toolkit. This provides basic graph algorithms, such as BFS, DFS, Topological Sort, Kosaraju's, and Ford-Fulkerson.
3. A Recommendation Engine. This uses the Graph representation to provide recommendations to users of services.
